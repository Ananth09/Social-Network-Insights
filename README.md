## Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of social network data, including:

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Understanding and preparing the dataset.
- **Graph Construction:** Building and analyzing network graphs.
- **Community Detection:** Identifying and analyzing communities within the network.
- **Influencer Identification:** Measuring centrality to find key influencers.
- **Recommendation System:** Designing algorithms to suggest new connections.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- **Graph Construction**
- **Community Detection**
- **Influencer Identification**
- **Recommendation System**

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is derived from the SNAP Facebook Social Circles dataset. It includes the following files:

facebook_combined.txt: A combined file containing edges between users in the Facebook social network. Each line represents a connection between two users.
facebook: The Facebook Social Circles dataset typically includes several files for each ego network.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory for detailed analysis and implementation:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/SocialNetworkAnalysis.ipynb
```

In the notebook, youâ€™ll find:

1. **Data Exploration:** Loading and inspecting the dataset.
2. **Graph Construction:** Building and analyzing the network graph.
3. **Community Detection:** Applying algorithms to identify communities.
4. **Influencer Identification:** Calculating centrality measures.
5. **Recommendation System:** Designing and evaluating connection recommendations.
